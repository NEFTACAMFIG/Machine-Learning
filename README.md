# Machine-Learning

This repository put in practice some basic Machine Learning Algorithms in the `Regression_Models.py` we can find the Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries. The datasets are made available to public for the purpose of health data analysis. The dataset "Life Expectancy" contains detailed information about this topic (life_expectancy.csv from Exercise-4).

The exercise consist into apply a Linnear Regression and Feature Regression model with Scikit-Learn to predict the life expectancy of the dataset.

Additionally, there is a third option after to make a "Backward Elimination", to check if the model improve its performance once that the less meaningful independent variables are eliminated.

On the other hand, in the file `Decision_Tree_&_Random_Forest.py` a loan repository is used to test a Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithm to predict based on the independent varibales if a person should receive or not a loan.
